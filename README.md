# Periodic Table Application

This is a simple Angular application that displays a list of chemical elements.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:** After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server:** Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server:
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
